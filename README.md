# etch-a-sketch
In this project, I built a browser version of something between a 
sketchpad and Etch-A-Sketch. First I created a grid of squares. 
Every time the pointer of the mouse hovers over these squares, 
they change color. The user will have the chance to clear the grid 
and start over the "drawing", and will be able to change the grid 
size. Meaning, they will be able to decide the number of the 
squares that consist the grid.
