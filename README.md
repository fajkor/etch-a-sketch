# etch-a-sketch

In this project we' re going to build a browser version of something between a sketchpad 
and Etch-A-Sketch. To do that we' re gonna need to build a grid of squares. Every time the
pointer of the mouse (or the finger, in case of a touchscreen) hovers over these squares,
they are going to change color. The user will have the chance to clear the grid and start
over the "drawing", and will be able to change the grid size. Meaning, they will be
able to decide the number of the squares that consist the grid.
